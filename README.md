- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasterKitty2006
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly computer hardware and repair, but figured coding would be a good idea. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, but I plan to learn Python and maybe C#/++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, but I'm sure something will come up.
- 📫 You can reach me at masterkitty2006@gmail.com, but I have no clue why you'd ever want to do that. I have practically no skills as a coder yet, however
I'm sure as I learn more and more I could be more useful to speak with. I don't know, I'll just see what my future holds...
